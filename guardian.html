                <b>Info:</b> Guardian was the first of the guardians to join and was the one who formed the group in
                order to protect others. <br />
                Her real name is only known to those who joined during the beginning. She was taken from her home
                universe to<br />
                become a vessel for light and has been unable to return. She has taken up the mantle of guardian after a

                <b>Power description:</b> Guardians power is the element of light. She is able to manipulate light into
                projectiles, barriers<br />
                and weapons. She can manipulate any light around her but can also create her mana from the energy she
                gets from sleeping or<br />
                eating. Along with this, she can also mimic other peopleâ€™s abilities. Once she learns how someone uses
                their power, she can <br />
                create a reflection of it with her own light.
