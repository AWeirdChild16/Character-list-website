                <b>Info:</b> Apprentice was taken in by Lilith when she was still a child and has stayed by her side
                ever since.<br />
                She eventually took them in as her apprentice and has been slowly helping them regain the power they
                lost. Their<br />
                real name and origin are unknown to everyone, even Lilith. While they stay in their small form most of
                the time, <br />
                they are able to shift into both a human one and one that resembles a large snake or Wyrm, this is
                thought to be <br />
                their true self. They have sworn loyalty to Lilith and plans to stay by her side for as long as they are
                able.

                <b>Power description:</b> Apprentice is learning witchcraft from Lilith. They have a fair grasp of the
                elemental<br />
                magic , especially the shadow and air elements, and uses them regularly in battle. Along with this, they
                are able<br />
                to shift into three different forms, a small form that is agile and uses the least amount of energy to
                sustain, a<br />
                human form that uses moderate energy but is easier to cast spells in and a large Wyrm form that is
                incredibly <br />
                strong but uses vast amounts of energy, meaning they can only keep that form for short periods of time.
