                <b>Info:</b> Apprentice was taken in by Lilith when she was still a child and has stayed by her side ever since.<br> 
                She eventually took them in as her apprentice and has been slowly helping them regain the power they lost. Their<br> 
                real name and origin are unknown to everyone, even Lilith. While they stay in their small form most of the time, <br>
                they are able to shift into both a human one and one that resembles a large snake or Wyrm, this is thought to be <br>
                their true self. They have sworn loyalty to Lilith and plans to stay by her side for as long as they are able.
