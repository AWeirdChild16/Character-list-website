                    <b>Info:</b> Charlie started as Draven's secretary abut had to flee after an incident at the
                    company.<br />
                    She stayed with Draven and his brother Travis and would wander through different universes,
                    looking<br />
                    for somewhere they could stay. After a couple months they found guardian and joined her to become
                    the<br />
                    first guardians. Charlie works as the guardianâ€™s tech and communications, her fierce loyalty and
                    quick<br />
                    thinking making her one of the most vital components to the team.

                    <b>Power description:</b> Charlies power stems from the element of lightning. It acts as a charge
                    of<br />
                    electricity that can conduct through virtually any material. When she touches a surface, she can
                    push<br />
                    an electric charge into it. Alternatively, if she holds her hands together, she can charge her
                    power<br />
                    and send out a massive blast that encompasses everything around her. This, however, takes a lot of
                    <br />
                    energy and can leave her exhausted afterwords.
