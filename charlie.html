                <b>Power description:</b> Charlies power stems from the element of lightning. It acts as a charge of<br />
                electricity that can conduct through virtually any material. When she touches a surface, she can push<br />
                an electric charge into it. Alternatively, if she holds her hands together, she can charge her power<br />
                and send out a massive blast that encompasses everything around her. This, however, takes a lot of
                <br />
                energy and can leave her exhausted afterwords.
