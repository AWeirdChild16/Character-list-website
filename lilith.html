                <b>Info:</b> Lilith has been learning magic since she was a child and has mastered all of the different
                branches.<br />
                She is constantly looking to push the barriers of magic and has even managed to grant herself eternal
                youth. While<br />
                she is the most powerful mage in existence, her and her apprentice use their powers to torment a local
                kingdom. <br />
                She has close ties to Melonie and routinely supply her Knights and Bishops with spells and potions.

                <b>Power description:</b> Lilith is a master of all five areas of witchcraft. Her skills make it so that
                she can <br />
                do practically anything. From apothecary to conjuring, her magic is so ingrained into her very being
                that it has <br />
                caused her to stop aging. She fights with mainly elemental spells and potions but will also use ruins or
                conjuring <br />
                if the situation calls for it.
